== Installation ==

Upload the plugin folder containing both files to wp-content/plugins/ and activate from the Plugin administrative menu.

Note: The WYSIWYG editor must be completely disabled for this plugin to work. Of course, since you want an advanced code editor you shouldn't be using that anyway!
